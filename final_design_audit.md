# Final Design Audit: Vite+Express to Next.js App Router Migration

This document presents the findings from the final design audit comparing the original Vite+Express implementation with the migrated Next.js App Router version.

## Audit Findings

### 1. "Who We Are" Section

| Issue | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Background Styling | ✅ Fixed | Added proper background color (`bg-apple-gray-50`) and padding (`py-32 md:py-40`) |

## Remaining Considerations

While all major design inconsistencies have been addressed, here are some considerations for future refinement:

1. **Browser Testing**: The design should be tested across different browsers to ensure consistent rendering of CSS effects, particularly for:
   - Backdrop blur effects
   - CSS gradients
   - Animation performance

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Consider further optimizing image loading with Next.js Image component
   - Review component re-renders to minimize unnecessary updates
   - Analyze and optimize animation performance on lower-end devices

3. **Accessibility Improvements**:
   - Ensure proper contrast ratios for all text elements
   - Verify keyboard navigation works correctly with the new scroll indicators
   - Add appropriate ARIA attributes to interactive elements

## Conclusion

The migration from Vite+Express to Next.js App Router has been successfully completed with careful attention to design details. The migrated version now closely matches the original design in terms of:

- Visual styling and aesthetics
- Animation effects and transitions
- Interactive behaviors
- Layout and spacing
- Typography and color scheme

The Apple-inspired design language has been preserved throughout the migration, ensuring a consistent and premium user experience.
